these files I created as a way to visualize Splay Trees. Not entirely sure if this program is usefull/needed for this project. Creating it at least gave me more insight and practice on Splay Trees.

the "test" file is the compiled code from "practice.cpp" It can be used as such:

./test "values in splay tree"

for example:
./test 2 4 6 8 9 12
