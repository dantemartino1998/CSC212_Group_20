Topic specific code instruction:
```
**Splay Tree**
^^^

**_Implement the Data Structure (using classes)_**

- ensure at least `insert` & `search` methods are correct
  - `search` must also return/print the count

- generate a DOT file for visualization

**_Store the words of an input text file_**

- for the word ($node$) in the tree, a count with the number of repeats must also be stored
```
