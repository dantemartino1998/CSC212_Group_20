# CSC212_Group_20
The repository for Group 20 CSC212 group project. Not really sure how the Repo should be configured, but at least it is created.

Although, I am confused, there is this statement in the Project document:

```
Code Repository
Your code from start to finish will live on GitHub.

Each group member must be connect via their own github account to a primary account which will be used for submission.

Individual contributions must be clear within the ‘commits’ of the repo.
```

I do not really understand what it means by Primary Account...
